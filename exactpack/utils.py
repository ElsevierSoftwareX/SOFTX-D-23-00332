    Solver discovery is performed by walking the directory tree
    containing the :mod:`exactpack` module, and looking for classes
    that inherit from :class:`exactpack.base.ExactSolver`.  The return
    value is a list of names of solver classes.

    Since the directory walk is somewhat inefficient, it is suggested
    that the results be cached by the caller, if they are likely to be
    needed again.
